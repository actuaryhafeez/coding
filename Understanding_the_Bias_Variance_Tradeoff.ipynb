        "### Whenever we discuss model prediction, it’s important to understand prediction errors (bias and variance). There is a tradeoff between a model’s ability to minimize bias and variance. Gaining a proper understanding of these errors would help us not only to build accurate models but also to avoid the mistake of overfitting and underfitting.\n",

        "### Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. Model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. It always leads to high error on training and test data.\n",

        "# What is variance?\n",
        "### Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasn’t seen before. As a result, such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates on test data.\n",
